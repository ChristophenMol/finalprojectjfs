        <p>Captured was started as a way for photographers and artists to build a portfolio and sell their work independently to ensure that 100% of the sales are theirs, devoid of middlemen or exploitation. Get all of the exposure, and keep all of the profits. You can license your work, or sell it in the format of your choice.</p>
